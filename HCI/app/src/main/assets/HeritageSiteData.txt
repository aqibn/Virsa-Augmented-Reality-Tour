		"description": "The Badshahi Mosque (Urdu: Imperial Mosque) in Lahore was commissioned by the sixth Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. The real name of the mosque as written in calligraphy on marble above the entrance gate is read as Masjid Abul Zafar Muhy-ud-Din Mohammad Alamgir Badshah Ghazi. Constructed between 1671 and 1673, it was the largest mosque in the world upon construction.\n\nToday it is the second largest mosque in Pakistan and the fifth largest mosque in the world. It is Lahore's most iconic and famous landmark and a major tourist attraction. Aurangzeb's mosque's architectural plan is similar to that of his father (Shah Jehan) the Jama Masjid in Delhi; though it is much larger, it also functions as an idgah.\n\nThe courtyard which spreads over 276,000 square feet, can accommodate one hundred thousand worshippers and ten thousand worshippers can be accommodated inside the mosque. The minarets are 196 feet (60 m) tall. The Mosque is one of the most famous [Mughal] structures, but suffered greatly under the reign of Maharaja [Ranjit Singh]. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan included the Badshahi Mosque in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site."},

The tomb is rectangular in plan with eight perimeter rooms and a central chamber, surmounted by a low dome on a tall base. The space inside is empty, as the actual tomb of Dai Anga lies below in a subterranean chamber. Interior decoration includes inscriptions from the Q'uran. The exterior of the tomb was originally covered with mosaics, but in the manner of many tombs in Lahore, most of these have been worn or stripped away over the centuries. However, the tomb does retain its original four chattris (kiosks) at each of its corners, which contribute a certain lightness to the otherwise weighty structure."},

The tomb of Dai Anga is known as the Gulabi Bagh. Her family was closely associated with the Mughal empire. Her husband Murad Khan served Emperor Jahangir as Magistrate of Bikaner, and her son Muhammad Rashid Khan, was the best archers in the kingdom, and died fighting in the service of Shah Jahan's eldest son Dara Shikoh. Shah Jahan highly regarded Zeb Un Nisa.\n\nThe exterior of the mosque has been embellished with fine tile work similar to that seen at the mosque of Wazir Khan in Lahore. The interior also displayed fine frescoes previously, unfortunately these have largely been replaced by cheap modern ceramic tiles over the last 3 years breaking a 360-year-old tradition.(from Wikipedia)"},

When the Emperor Akbar expanded the city eastward and divided it into nine districts or Guzars, Bhati Gate and its bazar marked the boundary between Guzar Mubarak Khan (east) and Guzar Talwarra (west).It was called Bhati gate because it was capital of the Emperor Raja Bhati in very ancient times. He is ancestor of present-day Bhati Rajputs. The area inside the gate is well known throughout the city for its food. Just outside of Bhati Gate is Data Durbar, the mausoleum of the Sufi saint Ali Hajweri (also known as Data Sahib Ganjbaksh).
